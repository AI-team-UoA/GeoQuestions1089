# GeoQuestions1089

GeoQuestions1089 is a geospatial question-answering dataset that targets the Knowledge Graph [YAGO2geo](https://yago2geo.di.uoa.gr/). It contains 1089 triples of geospatial questions, their answers, and the respective SPARQL/GeoSPARQL queries. It has been used to benchmark two state of the art Question Answering engines, [GeoQA2](https://github.com/AI-team-UoA/GeoQA2) and [the engine of Hamzei et al](https://github.com/hamzeiehsan/Questions-To-GeoSPARQL).

The repository is organized as follows:
- `GoST/`: contains a transpiler that rewrites queries to use materialized relations.
- `engines/`: contains the versions of the engines that were used in the benchmark.
- `generated-queries/`: contains the queries generated by the engines for the benchmark.
- `GeoQuestions.json`: contains 1089 question-query-answer triples.
- `GeoQuestionsNoAnswers.json`: like `GeoQuestionsNoAnswers.json` but without the answers .

The dataset is organized as follows:

| Description | Range |
| --- | --- |
|Triples targeting YAGO2geo | 1-895 |
|Triples targeting YAGO2 + YAGO2geo | 896-1017 |
|Triples with questions that contain mistakes | 1018-1089 |

## GoST

To use the transpiler use the following command:
```
java -cp PATH/TO/GOST_EXECUTABLE gr.uoa.di.ai.Transpiler QUERY
```
